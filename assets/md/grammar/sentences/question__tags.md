#### **📜 Definition**

A **question tag** is a **short question at the end of a statement** to confirm information or seek agreement.

💡 **Example:**  
✅ _You like coffee, **don’t you**?_ ☕✅  
✅ _She isn’t coming, **is she**?_ ❌👩

---

#### **1️⃣ Structure of Question Tags**

📝 **Form:**

- **Positive statement → Negative tag**
- **Negative statement → Positive tag**

💡 **Examples:**  
✅ _You are a teacher, **aren’t you**?_ 🎓  
✅ _He doesn’t like spicy food, **does he**?_ 🌶️

#### **2️⃣ Rules for Forming Question Tags**

##### **🔹 Rule 1: Use Auxiliary Verbs from the Statement**

The question tag **must match** the auxiliary (helping) verb in the statement.

💡 **Examples:**  
✅ _She **has** finished the work, **hasn’t she**?_ ✔️  
✅ _They **will** come to the party, **won’t they**?_ 🎉

---

##### **🔹 Rule 2: If There’s No Auxiliary Verb, Use "do/does/did"**

If the main verb is in **Present Simple or Past Simple**, use **do/does/did** in the tag.

💡 **Examples:**  
✅ _She **likes** chocolate, **doesn’t she**?_ 🍫  
✅ _They **went** home early, **didn’t they**?_ 🏡

---

##### **🔹 Rule 3: "I am" Uses "Aren’t I"**

Although grammatically "amn't I" would be correct, **"aren’t I"** is used instead.

💡 **Example:**  
✅ _I am your friend, **aren’t I**?_ 🤝

---

##### **🔹 Rule 4: Imperatives Use "Will You?" or "Won’t You?"**

💡 **Examples:**  
✅ _Close the door, **will you**?_ 🚪🔒  
✅ _Help me with this, **won’t you**?_ 🤝

For **negative imperatives**, use **"will you?"**  
✅ _Don’t be late, **will you**?_ ⏰❌

---

##### **🔹 Rule 5: "Let's" Uses "Shall We?"**

💡 **Examples:**  
✅ _Let’s go to the park, **shall we**?_ 🌳  
✅ _Let’s not argue, **shall we**?_ 🤫
