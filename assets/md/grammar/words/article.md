#### **Definition**
An **article** is a word that **modifies a noun** and defines whether it is **specific or general**. There are **two types of articles** in English:
- The definite article** (_the_)
- The **indefinite articles** (_a, an_)

### 🔹 **1. The Definite Article: "The"** 🔍
✅ **"The"** refers to a **specific** person, place, or thing.

📌 _Examples:_
- **The** sun is shining. ☀️ (There is only one sun.)
- I saw **the** doctor yesterday. 🩺 (A specific doctor we both know.)
- He sat on **the** chair next to me. 💺 (A particular chair.)

### 🔹 **2. The Indefinite Articles: "A" & "An"** 🤔

✅ **"A" and "An"** refer to **a general or non-specific noun**.

📌 _When to use "A" or "An":_

|📝 Article|📢 Rule|📌 Example|
|---|---|---|
|**A**|Before words starting with a **consonant sound**|_A_ cat is in the garden. 🐱|
|**An**|Before words starting with a **vowel sound** (A, E, I, O, U)|_An_ apple fell from the tree. 🍏|

📌 _Note:_ The choice depends on **sound, not spelling**!

🚫 _An university_ (❌ Incorrect) → ✅ _A university_ (✔ Correct) 🎓 (because "university" sounds like "yoo")  
🚫 _A hour_ (❌ Incorrect) → ✅ _An hour_ (✔ Correct) ⏳ (because "hour" starts with a silent "h")


### 🔹 **3. When NOT to Use Articles** 🚫
❌ Articles are **not used** in the following cases:

✅ **Plural general nouns**  
📌 _Dogs_ are loyal animals. 🐶 (_Not "The dogs" unless referring to specific ones._)

✅ **Proper nouns (names, countries, languages, etc.)**  
📌 I live in _France_. 🇫🇷 (_Not "The France"_)  
📌 He speaks _Spanish_. 🗣 (_Not "The Spanish" unless referring to people_)

✅ **Meals, sports, and academic subjects**  
📌 We had _dinner_ at 7 PM. 🍽 (_Not "The dinner" unless referring to a specific one_)  
📌 She plays _tennis_. 🎾 (_Not "The tennis"_)

### 🎯 **Final Notes**
✅ **"The"** → For **specific** nouns.  
✅ **"A" / "An"** → For **general, non-specific** nouns.  
✅ Use **"A"** before consonant sounds, **"An"** before vowel sounds.  
✅ No article for **general plural nouns, names, and languages**.
