A **conjunction** is a word that connects **words, phrases, or clauses** in a sentence. Conjunctions help make sentences smoother and more coherent.

### 🔹 **1. Coordinating Conjunctions** ⚖
These conjunctions connect words, phrases, or independent clauses that are **equally important.

✅ **FANBOYS** (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)

### 🔹 **2. Subordinating Conjunctions** 🔗
These conjunctions connect a **dependent clause** (cannot stand alone) to an **independent clause**.

✅ **Common Subordinating Conjunctions:**

| 🔤 Conjunction | ✨ Function         | 📌 Example                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Because**    | Reason             | She left early _because_ she was tired. 😴     |
| **Although**   | Contrast           | _Although_ it was cold, he wore a T-shirt. ❄👕 |
| **Since**      | Reason/Time        | I haven’t seen her _since_ she left. 📅        |
| **If**         | Condition          | _If_ you study, you will pass. 📚              |
| **While**      | Time/Contrast      | She listened _while_ he spoke. 🗣👂            |
| **Unless**     | Negative condition | You can’t go _unless_ you finish your work. ✅  |

📌 _Note:_ A **subordinating conjunction** starts a dependent clause, which **cannot** stand alone.

🚫 _Because it was raining._ (❌ Incorrect)  
✅ _Because it was raining, we stayed inside._ (✔ Correct)

### 🔹 **3. Correlative Conjunctions** 🔁
These conjunctions **work in pairs** to connect equal sentence elements.

✅ **Common Correlative Conjunctions:**

|🔤 Pair|✨ Function|📌 Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Either… or**|Choice|You can have _either_ tea _or_ coffee. ☕🍵|
|**Neither… nor**|Negative choice|_Neither_ Tom _nor_ Jerry was there. 🚫|
|**Both… and**|Addition|She is _both_ smart _and_ kind. 🤓❤️|
|**Not only… but also**|Emphasis|He is _not only_ funny _but also_ intelligent. 😂🧠|
|**Whether… or**|Uncertainty|I don’t know _whether_ he’ll come _or_ not. 🤷‍♂️|

📌 _Note:_ Correlative conjunctions must connect **parallel** sentence elements.

🚫 _She is both talented and loves to dance._ (❌ Incorrect)  
✅ _She is both talented and hardworking._ (✔ Correct)

### 🎯 **Final Notes**

✅ **Coordinating conjunctions** join **equal** elements.  
✅ **Subordinating conjunctions** introduce **dependent** clauses.  
✅ **Correlative conjunctions** come in **pairs**.  
✅ **Punctuation matters!** Use a **comma** before coordinating conjunctions if joining two independent clauses.
